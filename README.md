## Documentation:

### [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops)

- [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/overview)
  > With Azure DevOps, you gain an integrated set of services and tools to manage your software projects, from planning and development through testing and deployment. Services are delivered through a client/server model. Many of them are delivered through an easy-to-use web interface that you can access from all major browsers. Some services, such as source control, build pipelines, and work tracking, can also be managed through a client.

### [Azure Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview)

- [Azure Monitor Metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics)
  > Azure Monitor Metrics is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data from monitored resources into a time series database. Metrics are numerical values that are collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time. Metrics in Azure Monitor are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios making them particularly useful for alerting and fast detection of issues. You can analyze them interactively with metrics explorer, be proactively notified with an alert when a value crosses a threshold, or visualize them in a workbook or dashboard

- [Azure Monitor Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs)
  > Azure Monitor Logs is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects and organizes log and performance data from monitored resources. Data from different sources such as platform logs from Azure services, log and performance data from virtual machines agents, and usage and performance data from applications can be consolidated into a single workspace so they can be analyzed together using a sophisticated query language that's capable of quickly analyzing millions of records.

- [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent)
  > The Azure Log Analytics agent collects telemetry from Windows and Linux virtual machines in any cloud or on-premises machines, and sends it collected data to your Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor.

### [Azure Arc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/overview)

- [Arc enabled servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview)
  > Azure Arc-enabled servers enables you to manage your Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network, or other cloud provider. This management experience is designed to be consistent with how you manage native Azure virtual machines. When a hybrid machine is connected to Azure, it becomes a connected machine and is treated as a resource in Azure. Each connected machine has a Resource ID, is included in a resource group, and benefits from standard Azure constructs such as Azure Policy and applying tags.
- [Arc enabled kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview)
  > With Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, you can attach and configure Kubernetes clusters located either inside or outside Azure. When you connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc, it will:
  > 
  > - Appear in the Azure portal with an Azure Resource Manager ID and a managed identity.
  > - Be placed in an Azure subscription and resource group.
  > - Receive tags just like any other Azure resource.

###  [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli)

- [Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  > The Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line tool to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It allows the execution of commands through a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or a script.
